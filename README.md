NOTE: this documentation is for version 2.x, which is a work-in-progress. You probably want to look at [version 1.1.1 docs](https://github.com/nomiddlename/log4js-node/tree/v1.1.1) instead.

This is a conversion of the [log4js](https://github.com/stritti/log4js)
framework to work with [node](http://nodejs.org). I started out just stripping out the browser-specific code and tidying up some of the javascript to work better in node. It grew from there. Although it's got a similar name to the Java library [log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/), thinking that it will behave the same way will only bring you sorrow and confusion.

The full documentation is available [here](https://nomiddlename.github.io/log4js-node/).

Out of the box it supports the following features:

* coloured console logging to stdout or stderr
* file appender, with configurable log rolling based on file size or date
* SMTP appender
* Amazon SES appender (using node-ses)
* GELF appender
* Loggly appender
* Logstash UDP appender
* logFaces (UDP and HTTP) appender
* multiprocess appender (useful when you've got worker processes)
* a logger for connect/express servers
* configurable log message layout/patterns
* different log levels for different log categories (make some parts of your app log as DEBUG, others only ERRORS, etc.)

## installation

```bash
npm install log4js
```

## usage

Minimalist version:
```javascript
var log4js = require('log4js');
var logger = log4js.getLogger();
logger.level = 'debug';
logger.debug("Some debug messages");
```
By default, log4js will not output any logs (so that it can safely be used in libraries). The `level` for the `default` category is set to `OFF`. To enable logs, set the level (as in the example). This will then output to stdout with the coloured layout (thanks to [masylum](http://github.com/masylum)), so for the above you would see:
```bash
[2010-01-17 11:43:37.987] [DEBUG] [default] - Some debug messages
```
See example.js for a full example, but here's a snippet (also in `examples/fromreadme.js`):
```javascript
const log4js = require('log4js');
log4js.configure({
  appenders: { cheese: { type: 'file', filename: 'cheese.log' } },
  categories: { default: { appenders: ['cheese'], level: 'error' } }
});

const logger = log4js.getLogger('cheese');
logger.trace('Entering cheese testing');
logger.debug('Got cheese.');
logger.info('Cheese is Gouda.');
logger.warn('Cheese is quite smelly.');
logger.error('Cheese is too ripe!');
logger.fatal('Cheese was breeding ground for listeria.');
```
Output (in `cheese.log`):
```bash
[2010-01-17 11:43:37.987] [ERROR] cheese - Cheese is too ripe!
[2010-01-17 11:43:37.990] [FATAL] cheese - Cheese was breeding ground for listeria.
```
