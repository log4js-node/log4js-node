[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/log4js.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/log4js/)

This is a conversion of the [log4js](https://github.com/stritti/log4js)
framework to work with [node](http://nodejs.org). I started out just stripping out the browser-specific code and tidying up some of the javascript to work better in node. It grew from there. Although it's got a similar name to the Java library [log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/), thinking that it will behave the same way will only bring you sorrow and confusion.

The full documentation is available [here](https://log4js-node.github.io/log4js-node/).

[Changes in version 3.x](https://log4js-node.github.io/log4js-node/v3-changes.md)

There have been a few changes between log4js 1.x and 2.x (and 0.x too). You should probably read this [migration guide](https://log4js-node.github.io/log4js-node/migration-guide.html) if things aren't working.

Out of the box it supports the following features:

- coloured console logging to stdout or stderr
- file appender, with configurable log rolling based on file size or date
- a logger for connect/express servers
- configurable log message layout/patterns
- different log levels for different log categories (make some parts of your app log as DEBUG, others only ERRORS, etc.)

Optional appenders are available:

- [SMTP](https://github.com/log4js-node/smtp)
- [GELF](https://github.com/log4js-node/gelf)
- [Loggly](https://github.com/log4js-node/loggly)
- Logstash ([UDP](https://github.com/log4js-node/logstashUDP) and [HTTP](https://github.com/log4js-node/logstashHTTP))
- logFaces ([UDP](https://github.com/log4js-node/logFaces-UDP) and [HTTP](https://github.com/log4js-node/logFaces-HTTP))
- [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/log4js-node/rabbitmq)
- [Redis](https://github.com/log4js-node/redis)
- [Hipchat](https://github.com/log4js-node/hipchat)
- [Slack](https://github.com/log4js-node/slack)
- [mailgun](https://github.com/log4js-node/mailgun)
- [InfluxDB](https://github.com/rnd-debug/log4js-influxdb-appender)

## Getting help

Having problems? Jump on the [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/log4js-node/shared_invite/enQtODkzMDQ3MzExMDczLWUzZmY0MmI0YWI1ZjFhODY0YjI0YmU1N2U5ZTRkOTYyYzg3MjY5NWI4M2FjZThjYjdiOGM0NjU2NzBmYTJjOGI) channel, or create an issue. If you want to help out with the development, the slack channel is a good place to go as well.

## installation

```bash
npm install log4js
```

## usage

Minimalist version:

```javascript
var log4js = require("log4js");
var logger = log4js.getLogger();
logger.level = "debug";
logger.debug("Some debug messages");
```

By default, log4js will not output any logs (so that it can safely be used in libraries). The `level` for the `default` category is set to `OFF`. To enable logs, set the level (as in the example). This will then output to stdout with the coloured layout (thanks to [masylum](http://github.com/masylum)), so for the above you would see:

```bash
[2010-01-17 11:43:37.987] [DEBUG] [default] - Some debug messages
```

See example.js for a full example, but here's a snippet (also in `examples/fromreadme.js`):

```javascript
const log4js = require("log4js");
log4js.configure({
  appenders: { cheese: { type: "file", filename: "cheese.log" } },
  categories: { default: { appenders: ["cheese"], level: "error" } },
});

const logger = log4js.getLogger("cheese");
logger.trace("Entering cheese testing");
logger.debug("Got cheese.");
logger.info("Cheese is Comt√©.");
logger.warn("Cheese is quite smelly.");
logger.error("Cheese is too ripe!");
logger.fatal("Cheese was breeding ground for listeria.");
```

Output (in `cheese.log`):

```bash
[2010-01-17 11:43:37.987] [ERROR] cheese - Cheese is too ripe!
[2010-01-17 11:43:37.990] [FATAL] cheese - Cheese was breeding ground for listeria.
```

## Note for library makers

If you're writing a library and would like to include support for log4js, without introducing a dependency headache for your users, take a look at [log4js-api](https://github.com/log4js-node/log4js-api).

## Documentation

Available [here](https://log4js-node.github.io/log4js-node/).

There's also [an example application](https://github.com/log4js-node/log4js-example).

## TypeScript

```ts
import log4js from "log4js";
log4js.configure({
  appenders: { cheese: { type: "file", filename: "cheese.log" } },
  categories: { default: { appenders: ["cheese"], level: "error" } },
});

const logger = log4js.getLogger();
logger.level = "debug";
logger.debug("Some debug messages");
```
